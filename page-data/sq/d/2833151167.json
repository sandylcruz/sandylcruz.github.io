{"data":{"siteContent":{"aboutMe":{"paragraphOne":"I’m a full-stack software engineer with experience with React, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Redux, ESLint, ES6, SQL, styled-components, HTML5, and CSS3.","paragraphTwo":"Ever since middle school, I’ve been interested in technology. I remember making a photoshop competition website on Geocities with basic HTML and CSS. As a former speech-language pathologist, I started making small applications to speed up writing evaluations, like a calculator that determines a client’s percentage of delay. From there, I got more and more interested in building applications. My background taught me how communicate high-level topics to a wide range of people, ranging from two-year-olds to parents.","paragraphThree":"Over the last year, I have I created an open-sourced npm package with WAI-ARIA accessible components. I also created a clone of OpenTable / Resy using Ruby on the backend, React on the frontend, and Postgres as the database. Currently I’m working on creating a todo-list application with calendar integration. I’m really interested in using my new skills to give back to the community and make websites more accessible.
